    "What is the machine learning problem you are trying to solve:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each year, the NCAA Men's College Basketball tournament (March Madness) gathers excitement and speculation from fans. Both casual and hard-core basketball fans compete to predict the outcome of each match, which frequently results in upsets. Our machine learning project aims to predict the outcome of a March Madness matchup using the data in the Kaggle.\n",
    " \n",
    "Why does the problem matter?\n",
    " \n",
    " Every year, thousands of people submit their tournament bracket predictions toof our predictive model could be used for creating bracket challenges as basketball fans compete against each other in predicting the outcomes of each  contests for chances to win big prizes and bragging rights. At this point it has become college basketball culture and people take it very seriously. From the casual perspective, where people pick winners based on their favorite mascot, to more serious analytical perspectives where people leverage statistical patterns - we thought it would be interesting to take a machine learning approach. \n",
